# Project 3 – Gurgaon Housing Data

This project focuses on analyzing housing and real estate data from Gurgaon using data science techniques. The objective of this project is to understand patterns, trends, and insights related to property data through data exploration and analysis.

The project includes data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization to derive meaningful insights from the housing dataset.

## Note on Model Files
This project uses two trained model files (`.pkl`).  
Due to GitHub file size limitations, these `.pkl` files are not included in this repository.

The analysis, logic, and results are fully demonstrated in the notebook.

## Project Highlights
- Housing and real estate data analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Insight generation using data science concepts

This project is part of a larger data science portfolio and will continue to evolve with additional improvements and learning.
