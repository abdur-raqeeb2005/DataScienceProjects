# Project 3 – Gurgaon Housing Data

This project focuses on analyzing housing and real estate data from Gurgaon using data science techniques. The objective of this project is to understand patterns and trends in property data and use them to estimate the final price of housing properties.

The project includes data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization to derive meaningful insights related to property pricing.

## Note on Model Files
This project uses two `.pkl` files that contain a large amount of data.  
These files are used to determine the final price of the housing data.  
Due to their large file size, they are not added to this GitHub repository.

## Project Highlights
- Gurgaon housing and real estate data analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Price estimation using data science concepts

This project is part of a growing data science portfolio.
